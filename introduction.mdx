# MolinDB Overview

MolinDB is a powerful managed vector database that provides seamless long-term memory for high-performance AI applications. With its cloud-native architecture, simple API, and hassle-free infrastructure, MolinDB makes it effortless to store and retrieve vector embeddings. By serving fresh, filtered query results with low latency, MolinDB empowers AI applications to operate at the scale of billions of vectors.

## Vector Embeddings: Enabling Long-Term Memory for AI

AI applications that involve large language models, generative AI, and semantic search heavily rely on vector embeddings. These embeddings represent semantic information, allowing AI systems to gain understanding and maintain a long-term memory that aids in executing complex tasks effectively.

## Efficient Storage and Querying at Scale

MolinDB, as a vector database, excels in storing and querying vector embeddings quickly and at scale. Unlike traditional scalar-based databases that struggle with the complexity and volume of such data, MolinDB leverages optimized storage techniques and advanced querying capabilities. It combines the familiar features of traditional databases with the exceptional performance of vector indexes, ensuring efficient and real-time analysis of vector data.

## Storing Records with Vector Data

In MolinDB, each record within an index consists of a unique ID and an array of floats representing a dense vector embedding. This structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of vector data, enabling seamless integration with AI applications.

## Features

- **100% Recall**: Advanced indexing and retrieval algorithms you can expect 100% recall accuracy when querying vector embeddings.
- **Serverless**: Our database operates in a serverless environment, eliminating the need for infrastructure management and reducing operational costs.
- **Scalable**: The database is designed to handle large-scale deployments and can easily scale to accommodate growing data volumes.
- **Efficient Storage**: We employ optimized compression techniques to minimize storage requirements while maintaining fast access to vector embeddings.
- **Flexible Querying**: Our database supports various querying methods, including nearest neighbor search and range queries, allowing you to find the most relevant embeddings for your use case.
- **API Integration**: We provide a comprehensive API that allows seamless integration with your existing applications and workflows.
